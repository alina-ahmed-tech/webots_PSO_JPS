<h1>PSO (Particle Swarm Optimisation) for dynamic global zone allocation and JPS for local path finding. </h1>

<p>Fellow robot obstacle avoidance was not implemented, so PSO operated on simulated robot states (battery, location, efficiency) and dynamic environment data (zone dirtiness). the project successfully showcased PSOâ€™s adaptability and efficiency in a multi-agent zone-cleaning scenario. The printed results in the console reflect intelligent decision-making under changing conditions which is the core focus of AI Optimisation. </p>
